# Effective Software Testing (Ruby)

This repo contains the code examples from "[Effective Software Testing](https://www.manning.com/books/effective-software-testing)"
book (by Mauricio Aniche), but written in Ruby and Minitest,
instead of Java/JUnit.

> ðŸš§ **Currently a Work in Progress** ðŸš§

As soon as I finish a chapter, I "translate" the Java/JUnit code to Ruby/Minitest.

## Main Takeaways

Each directory of this repo contains its own README with the main takeaways I took from each chapter.
