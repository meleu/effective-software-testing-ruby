# Effective Software Testing (Ruby)

This repo contains the code examples from "[Effective Software Testing](https://www.manning.com/books/effective-software-testing)"
book (by [Mauricio Aniche](https://github.com/mauricioaniche)), but using
Ruby/Minitest instead of Java/JUnit.

## Table of Contents

## Chapter Notes

Each directory of this repo refers to a chapter of the book and contains its
own README. There you can see the main takeaways I took from each chapter (and
maybe some caveats about the code translation).

## Dependencies

The code in this repository was tested in Ruby 3.1.2 and Minitest 5.18.
For more details, check the [Gemfile](./Gemfile).
